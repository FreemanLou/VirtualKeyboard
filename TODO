-Improve the drawing of both Keymap and VirtualKeyboard (Same code)
-Create a handler class so that Keyboard View does not know about input device
-Add a window to change layout, font, and maps. The functions to load the items are already there! Just need to create a settings directory for preferences.
-The held down keys (ctrl, caps, shift, alt, etc) have an issue where they stay down. To replicate click one of the listed keys. Click an alphabet key. Then try click the held down key again. The key will stay stuck
-Add deskbar option to open the keyboard
